                  <div class="team-tile__description">
                    <p><span>Nathan Runkle</span> is the founder and president of Mercy For Animals. Raised on a farm in rural Ohio, Nathan has long had a deep connection with farmed animals. After a local farmed animal abuse case involving a piglet slammed headfirst into a concrete floor during an agricultural project at a nearby high school, Nathan founded MFA to give "food" animals a much-needed advocate in his local community.</p>
                    <p>Since founding MFA over a decade ago, Nathan has overseen the organization's growth into a leading national force in the prevention of cruelty to farmed animals and promotion of compassionate food choices and policies.</p>
                    <p>A nationally recognized speaker on animal advocacy, factory farming, and veganism, Nathan has presented at colleges, conferences, and many other forums from coast to coast.</p>
                    <p>Through his work with MFA, Nathan has been an outspoken advocate for animal rights, featured in hundreds of television, radio, and newspaper interviews, including on ABC’s <em>World News Tonight</em>, <em>Nightline</em>, and <em>20/20</em>, CNN, and National Public Radio, and in <em>USA Today</em>, <em>The New York Times</em>, the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, and the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>.</p>
                    <p>athan works closely with MFA's diverse group of members, supporters, and employees to develop and fulfill objectives within the organization's four areas of focus: education, legal advocacy, corporate outreach, and undercover investigations.</p>
                    <p>Nathan has worked alongside elected officials, corporate executives, heads of international organizations, academics, farmers, celebrities, and film producers to pass landmark farmed animal protection legislation, raise public awareness about vegetarianism, and implement animal welfare policy changes.</p>
                    <p><em>VegNews</em> magazine has recognized both MFA and Nathan for making substantial contributions to the vegetarian movement, naming Nathan one of the "25 Most Fascinating Vegetarians" and one of the country's "Top 20 Activists Under 30 Years Old," and twice naming MFA "Non-Profit of the Year." In 2009, at the age of twenty-five, Nathan became the youngest person ever inducted into the US Animal Rights Hall of Fame.</p>

                    <p>Vandhana Bala</p>
                    <span>General Counsel</span>
                  </div>

                  <div class="team-tile__description">
                    <p><span>Vandhana Bala</span> serves as general counsel for Mercy For Animals and oversees the organization’s legal initiatives, which include working with investigations department staff and local law enforcement for criminal prosecutions of farmed animal abusers, developing lawsuits and initiating complaints to governmental agencies relating to illegal agribusiness operations, assisting with the organization’s corporate governance and administrative issues, ensuring regulatory compliance for MFA’s community outreach activities, lecturing on legal issues relating to farmed animals, and supervising the legal intern program in Los Angeles.</p>
                    <p>Since joining MFA in 2011, Vandhana has worked on several investigations that have led to successful criminal prosecutions of farmed animal abusers, including the first-ever felony conviction for cruelty to factory-farmed poultry and charges of criminal animal abuse brought against two different factory farm owners. She also filed a successful petition with the Federal Trade Commission regarding false advertising by an egg factory farm. Vandhana has presented several talks to bar associations and law schools in the Chicago area, and was a speaker at the Animal Rights National Conference. She has also been interviewed by numerous media outlets on ag-gag bills and MFA’s undercover investigations.</p>
                    <p>An honors graduate of the Indiana University School of Law in Bloomington, Indiana, Vandhana received her undergraduate degree from Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut. She became licensed to practice law in 2000, and is currently admitted to practice in Illinois, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, and United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.</p>
                    <p>Vandhana began her legal career at a global law firm in Chicago, Illinois, where she spent five years as a litigation associate, gaining considerable experience in both state and federal litigation, and often serving on a team of national counsel in multidistrict class action lawsuits. Vandhana primarily defended large, multinational corporations in products liability and mass tort cases, and has extensive experience in all stages of trial court and appellate litigation. Vandhana later started her own practice through which she routinely handled a wide range of commercial matters, companion animal issues, and criminal cases.</p>
                    <p>Of South Indian descent, Vandhana grew up in a primarily vegetarian household. She became actively interested in animal rights after reading about animal protection issues in law school. Vandhana soon became committed to vegetarianism, and spent the next decade volunteering and working at animal shelters and animal hospitals in New York, Minnesota, and Illinois.</p>
                    <p>A staunch advocate of veganism, Vandhana aspires to see the day when animals are viewed as more than mere items of personal property in the eyes of the law. To that end, she is committed to using her legal background and training to combat farmed animals’ needless suffering at the hands of the meat, dairy, and egg industries. In 2011, Vandhana coauthored an article entitled “Legal Implications of Providing Veterinary Hospice and Palliative Care,” published in the journal Veterinary Clinics of North America: Small Animal Practice. Vandhana currently resides in Los Angeles with her beloved rescued canine companion, Shivani.</p>

                    <p><span>Jake Morton</span> serves as director of operations for Mercy For Animals and oversees day-to-day operations, administration, human resources, finances and governmental compliance. Additionally, Jake works with MFA’s education and communications departments to create concepts for campaigns, videos, media outreach, merchandise and advertising.</p>
                    <p>An Ohio native, Jake studied mechanical engineering at The Ohio State University and design at Harrington College of Design in Chicago. For nine years, Jake flourished in a corporate retailing career, focusing on management and operations for a major home decor and furnishings chain. His pioneering spirit took him all across the country, overseeing major development and human resource aspects of new store openings. At the same time, Jake gained extensive experience in community improvement and neighborhood business revitalization, working with local groups in numerous cities.</p>
                    <p>Through his work in the corporate arena, Jake has developed a keen understanding of how to cultivate positive and creative workplace cultures while giving staff the tools needed to thrive and grow in their positions. Jake’s retailing expertise has also made him the focus of countless articles on topics ranging from workplace culture to the state of design in home goods.</p>
                    <p>Activism has been a strong passion of Jake’s since an early age. For his youth efforts in the GLBT community, he was awarded the GLBT Mark McIntosh Scholarship to The Ohio State University. A longtime Mercy For Animals supporter and volunteer, Jake first became involved in animal protection issues as a teenager after meeting MFA’s founder, Nathan Runkle, during a vegan outreach event in Columbus, Ohio. At the time, Nathan was screening graphic undercover footage of animal cruelty on factory farms. With skepticism, Jake inquired more about the issue and organization. After some lively discussion, he began to consider the treatment of animals in agribusiness and later decided to adopt a vegan diet. As the saying goes, “the rest is history.”</p>

Matt also works with attorneys, veterinarians, and animal welfare experts to review covert footage and draft criminal complaints, and with local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies to secure animal cruelty convictions against individuals and facilities that abuse animals.</p>
                    <p>Investigations by MFA have led to raids of factory farms, rescues of abused and neglected farmed animals, passage of landmark anticruelty legislation, corporate animal welfare policy reforms, and millions of people's hearts and minds opened to the power of food choices to create a kinder world.</p>

After witnessing the needless suffering endured by cows, pigs, chickens, and other farmed animals, he decided to adopt a vegan lifestyle and become a committed animal advocate.</p>
                    <p>Matt now has many years of experience in the animal protection movement, managing successful campaigns, developing educational materials and websites, and coordinating fundraising and outreach events.

He also oversees MFA's highly influential ChooseVeg.com and MeatVideo.com websites, literature distribution, festival and youth outreach, and the efforts of MFA's thousands of volunteers around the country.</p>
                    <p>A graduate of Hofstra University, Nick is the author of “Change Of Heart: What Psychology Can Teach Us About Spreading Social Change” (Lantern, 2011) and “Veganomics: The Surprising Science on What Motivates Vegetarians, from the Breakfast Table to the Bedroom” (Lantern, 2014). He has lectured across the U.S. and Europe on effective animal advocacy, and his work for farmed animals has been featured by hundreds of media outlets, including “Time” magazine, “The Wall Street Journal,” and National Public Radio.</p>
                    <p>Nick didn't grow up with animals and never questioned what he ate until reading Peter Singer's book “Animal Liberation” at the age of 18. He went vegetarian right away, and vegan a few months later. Nick also immediately got involved with animal advocacy. A semester spent working in rural Mexico and a pair of speeches by powerful animal rights advocates led Nick to conclude that he could do the most good in the world by focusing his life on helping animals.</p>

                    <p><span>Johnathan Skinner</span> works as director of information technology for Mercy For Animals, building and maintaining the websites that serve as windows into veganism and the plight of farmed animals for thousands of people every day.</p>
                    <p>Raised in Calgary, Alberta, right in the middle of cattle country, Johnathan's upbringing was far from veg-friendly. It wasn't until his twenties that he met his first vegetarian. This chance encounter became a life-changing event and he quickly transformed from a cowboy-hat-wielding Calgary Stampede attendee into an animal rights advocate protesting outside the gates.</p>
                    <p>At the turn of the millennium, Johnathan moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, to start afresh with his new vegan lifestyle. He has spent most of the years since as a volunteer advocate for animal rights, organizing outreach and vegan social events, and interning with various organizations around the world, including Mercy For Animals in Chicago. He is currently the sole coordinator of Veg Fest Vancouver—an all-vegan summer street festival hosted right in the heart of downtown Vancouver.</p>
                    <p>Johnathan started his professional career as a video game programmer. Only a year out of high school, he landed a job creating a game for Nintendo. Since then he’s also worked on titles published by Microsoft, Sierra, Capcom, EA, and his own independent company, Veggie Games. Johnathan’s entrepreneurial drive gave rise to Steer Madness, a popular animal rights computer game of his own design, construction, and publication. More recently, he expanded into website and app development, finding himself designing and programming software systems for the world’s largest dating website, PlentyofFish.</p>
                    <p>Possessing the right combination of programming, design, database, and IT skills, along with his passion to make the world a better place for animals, Johnathan has settled very happily into his role at MFA.</p>

                    <p><span>Brooke Mays</span> serves as editor in chief for Mercy For Animals, overseeing all of the organization’s written material, including content for Compassionate Living magazine, grant requests, letters to the editor, and communications with media, corporations and the general public.</p>
                    <p>An artful master of the English language, Brooke holds a bachelor of arts in linguistics from the University of Michigan and a certificate to teach English as a foreign language from the University of Cambridge.</p>
                    <p>Along with her communications experience, she has tremendous passion for animal advocacy. For over a decade, Brooke has devoted great time and energy to companion animal protection, including direct care of shelter animals and adopting her own dog, Ambrose, who had been held for months at Chicago Animal Care & Control as evidence in a local cruelty case. Additionally, Brooke has worked hands-on with farmed animals, volunteering at sanctuaries nationwide.</p>
                    <p>Brooke's farmed animal advocacy experience also includes co-coordinating highly successful fundraising walks, working with her local public access station to air documentaries and public service announcements on factory farming, and organizing a Mother's Day "Say No to Veal" demo.</p>
                    <p>During the 2008 Celebrating Compassion Gala, Brooke was honored by MFA for her dedication to farmed animal protection with The Hope Award.</p>
                    <p>She has been highly successful in her time with MFA. Following the release of MFA's undercover investigation revealing extreme animal abuse at a mega egg factory farm, Brooke's letter on behalf of MFA to grocery giant Trader Joe’s led the company to immediately drop its supplier relationship with the cruel egg producer. She has proven time and again that the pen is mightier than the sword.</p>

                    <p><span>Cindy Harris</span> serves as major gifts officer for Mercy For Animals, identifying, cultivating, and soliciting major gifts while creating and sustaining long-term relationships with major donors. Philanthropy began early in Cindy’s life. Raised by her maternal grandparents, values such as patience, justice, hard work, and kindness for all beings were always first and foremost in her life. Cindy’s grandmother was an elder in the local church and her grandfather was one of the first union leaders for a large auto parts manufacturer, fighting for humane working conditions and fair pay for all workers. Such an upbringing helped instill in Cindy an affinity for work in the nonprofit community.</p>
                    <p>Cindy grew up on a small farm in southern Ohio. She remembers farm life fondly, but it never felt right eating animals she considered her companions. Cindy’s journey toward veganism began when she saw documentary footage of cruelty to animals on modern-day factory farms. She was shocked to learn about the horribly inhumane conditions animals are subjected to in the production of meat, dairy, and eggs. She quickly made the connection between abusive factory farming practices and the food on her plate and adopted a compassionate vegan diet. Cindy now grows most of her own food and finds that she is much happier knowing where it comes from. She has truly returned to her roots.</p>
                    <p>Since 1985, Cindy has worked with various nonprofit organizations, building successful fundraising campaigns. She is accomplished in all areas of business management, including strategic planning, board development, staff development, and fundraising methods. Her fundraising expertise encompasses annual giving; major gifts; planned giving; endowment funds; capital campaigns; and corporate, foundation, and government grants.</p>
                    <p>Committed to ongoing learning, in addition to executive management, nonprofit training, and best practices, Cindy continues to study all areas of transformational information, including metaphysics, theosophy, and spiritual awareness. She holds a certificate in fundraising from UCLA and in planned giving from California State University, Long Beach. Cindy also continues as an active member of the Association of Fundraising Professionals and the Planned Giving Round Table.</p>

                    <p><span>Susan Weingartner</span> serves as development projects manager for Mercy For Animals, overseeing event production and other donor relations and fundraising projects.</p>
                    <p>Susan began rescuing animals at an early age, from a pigeon with a broken wing she nursed back to health and set free, to a pair of large dogs she found on her way home from school.</p>
                    <p>Trained in the theater arts, dance, and film in southern California, Susan’s artistic career turned into an activist career as she learned about the horrific treatment of animals on factory farms and became a founding member and eventually the director of a vegan activist organization in 1990. A seasoned public speaker, Susan has spoken extensively about factory farming and the benefits of a vegan diet, and worked with dozens of nonprofit organizations, educating the public, planning events, and cultivating celebrity and donor relationships.</p>
                    <p>Susan brings over 25 years of experience in the animal rights movement to her position with MFA, and has followed a vegan lifestyle for just as many years. She has been involved in the production of several animal rights films, served on the board of directors for three different nonprofits, and produced dozens of events for various organizations, from small screenings at local universities to large benefit galas. She has also served 12 years on the screening committee of the prestigious Genesis Awards.</p>
                    <p>An accomplished photographer, Susan has shot rock bands in concert, actors for animal advocacy campaigns, and her greatest love, animal portraits. Combining her passion for helping animals with her love of photography has been a dream come true. Her photographs have appeared in magazines and on magazine covers from Rolling Stone to Bark magazine and in books, such as A Letter To My Cat and Catification. For years, she has taken photos of rescued animals for various animal protection organizations, including Mercy For Animals, which have raised funds in silent auctions and helped in the adoption of many homeless animals throughout the years.</p>
                    <p>Susan’s teenage son has been vegan his entire life. As a vegan parent discovering the need for a supportive community when her son was still a young child, Susan started one of the first vegan family groups, which thrives to this day in Los Angeles. Susan and her son share their home with their three extremely outgoing cats, Aragorn, Kali, and Michael.</p>

                    <p>It was his fascination for the art of storytelling through cinema and motion graphics that first propelled Lee into video production at the age of twelve in Mesa, Arizona.</p>
                    <p>Incorporating creative inspiration from diverse genres of film, music, and advertising, Lee has put his vision and passion to use, crafting cutting-edge and award-winning short films, advertisements, music videos, and visual art pieces, many with thought-provoking and political messages.</p>
                    <p>Lee oversaw the creation of Farm to Fridge, MFA’s powerful mini-documentary exposing the horrific conditions of America’s factory farms. The hard-hitting film, narrated by Oscar-nominated actor James Cromwell, has been viewed over twenty million times since its release. Lee was also the editor of the documentary Behind the Orange Curtain, which examines the prescription pill epidemic in Orange County and won the Orange County Filmmaking Award at the Newport Beach Film Festival. Lee has worked with the makers of documentaries Forks Over Knives and Unity (a follow-up to the acclaimed Earthlings), and assisted in the production of MFA advertisements, which have aired on MTV, Animal Planet, Bravo, and other networks.</p>

                    <p>Kristen attended Penn State University where she earned bachelor’s degrees in biology and psychology, along with a minor in law and liberal arts and honors in the Crime, Law, and Justice program. She also recently completed a master’s degree in primate conservation at Oxford Brookes University in England.</p>
                    <p>Kristen’s affinity for animals and nature dates back as far as she can remember, compelling her to become vegetarian while still in high school. In the course of researching animal welfare issues later in life, Kristen discovered the stark realities of modern farming practices and transitioned to a fully vegan lifestyle. This discovery also sparked an interest in pursuing farmed animal welfare advocacy full time.</p>
                    <p>Combining a passion for travel with a love of animals, Kristen has participated in wildlife volunteer projects on five continents. Her experience covers a wide spectrum, from bathing elephants in Thailand and caring for orphaned monkeys in Africa to conducting wildlife surveys in Ecuador and developing enrichment recommendations for a zoo in India. Kristen’s master’s thesis, completed in Sri Lanka, focused on how effectively providing wildlife and conservation education to travelers in a hotel setting enables them to make more responsible tourism choices.</p>
                    <p>A native of Pennsylvania, Kristen has called California home since she first moved to San Diego in 2009. She spends much of her free time outdoors where she enjoys hiking, kayaking and camping. Now living in Los Angeles, Kristen is enjoying the enormous variety of vegan food options and restaurants, including her current favorite, Veggie Grill. Kristen believes that we must each strive to live every day by her favorite quote from Mahatma Gandhi: “Be the change you wish to see in the world.”</p>

                  <div class="team-tile__description">
                    <p><span>Kate Ziegler</span> serves as senior investigations and research associate for Mercy For Animals. Kate works closely with the director of investigations, reviewing and analyzing evidence documented by MFA’s undercover investigators. She assists MFA’s legal team to determine potential violations of law, and conducts extensive research into agribusiness practices and animal welfare standards.</p>
                    <p>Kate monitors meat, dairy, and egg industry publications, as well as advancements in the farmed animal advocacy movement. She helps MFA track the impact of factory farming on animal health and behavior, the environment, and food safety, and how these issues relate to MFA’s mission to promote compassionate food choices and policies.</p>
                    <p>With Kate’s help, MFA’s investigations have led to landmark cruelty prosecutions, historic corporate policy changes, and increased consumer awareness of the plight of farmed animals. For instance, after MFA uncovered horrific abuse and neglect at Ontario Livestock Sales, law enforcement officials charged the owner and seven employees with a total of 21 counts of cruelty to animals. Following MFA’s investigation at Christensen Farms, several of the nation’s leading grocery retailers, including Safeway, Kmart, and Costco, announced plans to phase out gestation crates from their pork supply chains. And after MFA’s investigation at Bettencourt Dairies — a dairy supplier to Kraft Foods, Burger King, and other major fast-food chains — CNN, CBS, ABC, NBC, The Associated Press, the Los Angeles Times, the Chicago Sun-Times, The Miami Herald, and hundreds of other television, print, and online media outlets covered the case, reaching millions of people with the message of compassion.</p>
                    <p>A native of a racially and economically diverse neighborhood in Chicago, Illinois, Kate’s parents, siblings, and extended family taught her to be a socially conscious and compassionate individual. After learning about industrialized farming practices from a family friend, Kate began considering the suffering endured by farmed animals and making kinder food choices.</p>
                    <p>Graduating Phi Beta Kappa from Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, Kate majored in religious studies and minored in Latino studies. Kate’s honors thesis centered on Christian animal theologies, examining ways of compassionately considering non-human animals within the faith. During her college years, Kate also volunteered in a bilingual preschool classroom, walked dogs at the St. Paul Humane Society, built houses with Habitat for Humanity, and played varsity softball. While studying abroad in Guanajuato, Mexico, Kate worked as a veterinary technician and organized a citywide antirabies vaccination campaign.</p>
                    <p>After obtaining her bachelor’s degree, Kate volunteered as an administrative assistant in an inner-city high school, worked as a university research assistant, and served as a third-grade, dual-language educator. She also interned with a national animal protection organization’s faith outreach program in Washington, D.C., whereby she inspired religious leaders to endorse animal-friendly legislation, helped provide free veterinary services to low-income individuals, and assisted in the organization of events to end dog fighting.</p>

                    <p><span>Mikael Nielsen</span> serves as national volunteer coordinator for Mercy For Animals, recruiting and training activists throughout the United States, assisting with the development of MFA’s effective advocacy resources, and serving as MFA’s spokesperson in the greater Chicago area.</p>
                    <p>Mikael holds a bachelor's degree in economics and mathematics and worked for thirteen years in the international for-profit sector, focusing the last two on wind farm development all over the United States and Canada.</p>
                    <p>Born in Denmark, Mikael moved to the United States when he was ten years old. While always a lover of animals, it was watching a friendly turkey on TV that was to be killed for Thanksgiving in 1996 that brought animal protection ideals to the forefront for Mikael and motivated him to go vegetarian and then vegan a few years later.</p>
                    <p>Inspired by one of EarthSave Chicago's Conferences for Conscious Living in 2002, Mikael became involved with the group, coordinating outreach events, conferences, and the Compassion On Wheels (COW) TV van. He was also one of the founding organizers of the hugely popular Chicago VeganMania.</p>
                    <p>Having volunteered with MFA since January of 2006, Mikael became one of the organization's outreach coordinators in the spring of 2008. Since that time he has opened thousands of eyes to our powerful documentary Farm to Fridge through our Paid-Per-View program, passed out tens of thousands of leaflets, tabled hundreds of hours at festivals, and delivered many humane education presentations in Chicago public schools and elsewhere. Mikael has also planned several fundraisers, including Viva Las Vegan and the hugely popular Chicago Vegan Chef Showdown, as well as launched the "Why Love One but Eat the Other?" car magnet and window decal project, which has helped hundreds of drivers plant seeds of compassion wherever they go.</p>
                    <p>During MFA's 2008 Celebrating Compassion Gala, Mikael was honored for his dedication to protecting animals with the "Activist of the Year" award. Whether he is staffing a table at a festival with his 13-year-old daughter, Riley, or leafleting on the street with his fellow activists, Mikael always maintains a positive attitude and always has a smile.</p>
                    <p>Mikael currently resides in Chicago with his rescued dog, Oliver, and rescued cat, Maeby.</p>
                    <p>Mikael says that working for Mercy For Animals is a dream come true.</p>

                    <p><span>Sarah Von Alt</span> serves as digital campaigns coordinator for Mercy For Animals, overseeing the organization’s digital vegan advocacy efforts, including managing and increasing the impact of MFA's educational websites, veg-eating apps, and vegan-eating email resources.</p>
                    <p>Born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio, Sarah first became interested in animal rights and veganism in high school, and quickly became inspired to end the needless suffering of animals raised for food. With MFA founded in her hometown, Sarah began participating in local MFA events and activities. Sarah was also an integral part of the ballot initiative to ban some of the most abusive factory farming practices in Ohio. Before long, she joined the MFA team as Ohio campaign coordinator.</p>
                    <p>As Ohio campaign coordinator, Sarah worked with activists across the state to achieve meaningful change for farmed animals, and coordinated and oversaw hundreds of events. A believer in the power of humane education, Sarah has worked with teachers throughout Ohio, and in just the last year, has spoken before over 2,000 students on factory farming and compassion for animals.</p>
                    <p>Sarah’s passion for activism has spanned many years and extended to various social justice and environmental advocacy organizations. In addition to coordinating grassroots outreach efforts, Sarah has assisted with lobbying, campaign strategies, and public education.</p>
                    <p>A student of nonprofit administration and leadership, Sarah uses her knowledge of nonprofit organizations, community organizing, and resource management to be the most effective advocate for animals she can be. Using a variety of strategies, Sarah hopes to amplify the success of the existing base of volunteers and activists in the western United States and continue working to end the confinement and exploitation of sentient beings.</p>
                    <p>An advocate focused on maximum effectiveness, Sarah believes in taking the most impactful actions possible and asserts: “There is not one solitary lifestyle change that could have such far-reaching positive impacts as a vegan diet, and there is no other organization with such a strong focus on results like Mercy For Animals.” Sarah’s prior experience, passion for the animal rights movement, and background as MFA’s Ohio campaign coordinator have prepared her to carry forward MFA’s community outreach efforts throughout the western United States.</p>

                    <p><span>Alan Darer</span> serves as education project coordinator for Mercy For Animals, overseeing and executing the organization’s pro-veg online advertising campaigns, managing the MFA Fellowship program at elite universities, and coordinating MFA’s advocacy in international markets. A graduate of Vassar College, Alan studied biochemistry and math.</p>
                    <p>Raised as a vegetarian in upstate New York, Alan has always recognized that there is no meaningful difference between farmed animals and the companion animals we welcome into our homes and consider part of our families.</p>
                    <p>As a freshman in college, Alan attended a screening of MFA's documentary Fowl Play, which opened his eyes to cruel egg industry practices, such as debeaking and suffocation or maceration of male chicks at birth. Inspired to take immediate action, he became vegan and spent his winter break interning with MFA where he learned how to effectively advocate for animals.</p>
                    <p>Prior to serving as education project coordinator, Alan had been involved with MFA in a variety of capacities, beginning in Dallas in 2012 as the Texas campaign coordinator, and continuing throughout the Northeast where he gave media interviews, tabled to promote Meatless Mondays, hosted well-known speakers, and testified against ag-gag bills and confinement systems.</p>
                    <p>Alan is an advocate for all social justice causes, believing that oppression of any form has no place in society. Ever since learning about the cruel practices that farmed animals are subjected to, he’s wanted to dedicate his life to reducing the suffering of others. Alan is now thrilled to work every day on behalf of farmed animals.</p>
